# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest version gets security updates and bug fixes!

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you detect a vulnerability, either

- open a bug ticket
- or drop an email to security at beyondjava dot de (replacing "at" and "dot" by the corresponding special characters).

In most cases, I will react within a day. However, this is a non-commercial project run by an individual, so there might be a delay because I'm offroad, ill, or something like that. Also note that "react" doesn't necessarily mean "solve". Security flaws can be convoluted, so all I can do is to aim at a fast reaction speed, but I can't promise it.

## Known vulnerabilities

Please update to the latest version! At miminum, that should be version 20.0.2, but it's better to opt for the latest version because it contains the latest bugfixes.

- Until 20.0.1 the PDF viewer was affected by [CVE-2024-4367](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wgrm-67xf-hhpq). Version 20.0.2 fixes this.
